4 Approaches
- If/else
- Element variables
    - stores element to be rendered
- Ternary conditional operator ***
    - condition ? (operation_true):(operation_false)
- Short circuit operator
    - specific case of ternary conditional operator
    - if either we have to render something or nothing,we use Short circuit operator
    - eg:- render welcome sharath or nothing
